"""modules.quant — shared two-tier quantization package (design.md §2–§8).

A single copy imported by BOTH cache backends (``windowed_cache`` and
``windowed_eager_cache``); the backends differ only in ``hooks.py``. Everything
here is pure-tensor and CPU-testable — the only ``transformers`` dependency is
the rope module passed in at read time (for the Q-tier RoPE apply and the
one-time demotion un-rotate).

Design realities baked in (design.md):

- **Keep-original-positions.** Eviction never renumbers. A Q window's
  ``position_range`` (its original absolute positions) is frozen at first
  demotion; the read path applies RoPE at those fixed positions every step. No
  rerotation, no position override (§5).
- **Pinned grid by identity.** A window's int4 codes + fp16 scale/zero are
  written exactly once (first demotion) and never recomputed. A re-demotion
  reactivates the dormant ledger entry; it never re-quantizes (§3, §10).
- **v1 is batch-size 1.** ``materialize_effective_kv`` runs per row and the
  ledger/store carry no batch axis; callers guard ``q > 0`` to ``B == 1``
  (design.md §10).
