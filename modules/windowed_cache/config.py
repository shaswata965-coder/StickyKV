@dataclass
class WindowedCacheConfig:
    """User-facing configuration for the windowed KV cache.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window_size : int
        Size of each scoring window in tokens.  Must be > 0.
    num_sink_tokens : int
        Number of sink tokens always retained at the start.  Must be >= 0.
    local_window_size : int | float
        If int: number of local tokens (must be a multiple of *window_size*).
        If float: ratio in (0, 1] of the **cache budget** (not the full
        context) -- ``local ~= ratio * total_budget_tokens``, ``ceil`` then
        snap up to the nearest *window_size* multiple.  Guarantees the local
        region can never exceed the cache budget.
    cache_budget : float
        Fraction of full-cache memory to retain, in (0, 1].
        Must be ``float`` — ``int`` and ``bool`` are rejected with clear errors.
    track_scores : bool
        Enable telemetry recording.  Default ``False``.
    score_p : float
        Exponent ``p`` for Lp-norm pooling over query rows: the per-key score
        is ``s_j = (Σ_i A_ij^p)^(1/p)``, accumulated continuously across
        **prefill and decode**.  The cache stores per-window power-sums
        ``Σ_i A_ij^p`` (additive, so accumulation stays a plain ``+=``) and
        takes the ``1/p`` root at eviction time.  ``p = 1`` (default) is the
        plain H2O cumulative sum and is byte-identical to the prior behaviour.
        ``p > 1`` rewards keys attended intensely by a few queries over keys
        attended diffusely by many; because the largest term dominates the
        power-sum, a strong early spike is guarded against dilution by later
        diffuse attention.
    rerotate_on_evict : bool
        If ``True``, re-rotate surviving keys to contiguous positions after
        each eviction (StreamingLLM-style).  **Default ``False``.**  Re-rotation
        is only correct if the model also rebases the query's RoPE position to
        the compacted cache length every step; HuggingFace ``generate``
        (transformers <= 4.47) advances ``cache_position`` monotonically
        instead, so re-rotating keys while the query keeps its original absolute
        position corrupts RoPE phase after the first eviction.  Leaving this off
        keeps original key positions (KVPress / H2O behaviour), correct on any
        version.
    quant_ratio : float
        Two-tier split ``q`` in ``[0, 1]`` (design.md §7).  **Default 0.0** —
        the Q (int4) tier is disabled and the cache is byte-identical to the
        single-tier fp16 path.  When ``q > 0``, the evictable window budget is
        split by memory: ``(1-q)`` to the fp16 tier, ``q`` to the int4 tier
        (which holds ~4× the windows per byte).  Requires an even ``window_size``
        (int4 nibble packing).
    quant_memoize_read : bool, optional
        Cache the dequantized + RoPE'd Q tier between evictions, per layer.
        **Default ``None`` = auto: on at ``B == 1``, off above.**

        The memo is free at ``B == 1`` and pure waste of batch capacity above it.
        At ``B == 1`` decode is weight-bound — every weight is read once per step
        (16.06 GB for Llama-3.1-8B fp16, a 10.3 ms/token floor on an A100) and
        that floor is independent of KV size — so the memo's footprint costs
        nothing and it saves 7 of every 8 steps' dequant at ``window_size = 8``.

        At ``B > 1`` it is charged **per row**, and batch capacity is the whole
        thesis: batching is the only thing that amortizes the weight read, and
        ``B`` is capped by KV memory, which is exactly what this method
        compresses. Measured at the qasper steady state (``T_fp=565``,
        ``T_q=1136``, 32 layers, ``H_kv=8``, ``D=128``, fp16) the memo holds
        ~4.65 MB/layer/row ⇒ **~149 MB/row**, against ~125 MB/row for the actual
        two-tier KV — it more than doubles per-row memory and cuts max-``B`` from
        ~458 to ~204.

        Set ``True`` to force it on at ``B > 1``: it trades that batch capacity
        for ~8x fewer Q-tier dequants per step (the Phase-1 read path
        rematerializes the whole tier every step without it — design.md §8, which
        Phase 2's fused kernel is what actually fixes). Which side wins at max-``B``
        is a measurement the perf suite must make; the default is set by the
        memory bound, which is the one we can compute.
    quant_ratio : float
        (see above)

    Notes
    -----
    Scoring is H2O-style cumulative: every query row contributes to the
    per-key score at every step.  There is no observation window.
