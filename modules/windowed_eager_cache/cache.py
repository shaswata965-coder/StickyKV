"""WindowedCache — HuggingFace Cache integration for windowed KV cache.

Orchestration only.  No scoring math, no Top-K math, no attention computation,
no RoPE math — only calls into :mod:`state` and :mod:`policy`.

NOTE: This module is byte-identical to ``modules/windowed_cache/cache.py``
(backends only differ in their ``hooks.py``). Any change here MUST be mirrored
to the flash twin until the duplication is refactored away.

    Supports ``B > 1`` at any ``quant_ratio``, for **equal-length** prompts.
    Rows evict divergently — each ranks its own windows — but the tier split
    keeps the same *count* per row, so both tiers stay dense and rectangular

    kv_dtype : torch.dtype
        Data type of the KV cache tensors.
    rope_module : nn.Module
